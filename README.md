# pso_neural_net

This project requires two APIs: Qt and Qwt. 

Qt is an opensource API for GUI development in C++ and QML. 
You can donload the installer at the following location:

QWT is a legacy graph and plot plugin for Qt. Qt comes with its 
own Qt Charts, but is proprietary and requires an additional license. 
Instead, we use QWT.
